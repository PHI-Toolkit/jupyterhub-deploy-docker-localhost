# Background
This code base to deploy Jupyter Notebooks using JupyterHub is based on the open source reference implementation from https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-deploy-docker.

It also uses Docker (https://www.docker.com/) containers to manage the three pieces of software needed to run this set up:
1. JupyterHub - takes care of authentication and spawning of single-user notebook servers (containers)
2. Jupyter Notebooks - notebook environment with Python 3.6 kernel
3. PostgreSQL or SQLite database backend to store notebook user data

# Installation Guide - Quick

## First install on localhost machine
1. Install `Docker`, `docker-compose`, `git`. (...or run  `sudo install-docker-bionic.sh`.)
2. Open terminal app and cd to preferred workspace directory
3. `git clone` this repository: `git clone https://github.com/PHI-Toolkit/jupyterhub-deploy-docker-localhost.git`
4. `cd jupyterhub-deploy-docker-localhost`, locate buildhub.sh, make sure it is executable and run this script on command line.
5. Wait for the `buildhub.sh` script to finish, then locate `starthub.sh`, make sure it is executable, then run `./starthub.sh` on a terminal. To check:
    5.1 Built Docker contaiiners: run `docker images` on the terminal.
    5.2 Running containers (after running `./starthub.sh`: run `docker ps` on the terminal.
6. Open Chrome or Firefox browser and proceed to https://localhost. (Look up default login credentials on .env file.)

## First install on remote server

Follow steps 1-6 above and replace localhost with IP address of remote server.

## Starting and Stopping Containers
1. `cd` to the folder where you did `git clone` of the GitHub repository. (This is important to do before running any of the shell scripts below.)
2. To start containers, run `./starthub.sh`. Running this script also displays the logs for the running containers as they boot up and/or encounter any launch errors.
3. To stop containers, press `ctrl-C` if you see log file display on your terminal. When you see the terminal prompt, run `./stophub.sh`.
4. You can also use `./restarthub.sh` for stopping and restarting containers.

### Modifying the `.env` and `userlist` files

The `.env` is automatically created adter the first run of the `buildhub.sh` file. It contains all configurable parameters for this application:
1. Authentication - includes `dummy_authenticator` (default), `github_authenticator`
2. SSL Certificate - self-signed (default) or LetsEncrypt
3. Database for user data - SQLite or PostGreSQL
4. Custom logo (filename pointer to image)
5. Jupyter Notebook UI or JupyterLab
6. Versions of JupyterHub, JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook
7. OAuth, Notebook and Hub, PostGreSQL Authentication Credentials
8. Single-user Notebook server timeout (when idle servers are culled)

The `userlist` file is automatically created from `userlist-template` after the first run of `buildhub.sh`. For GitHub autentication, follow the template entry for recording GitHub username in the `userlist` file and assigning `admin` status. This can also be done through the `Admin` interface of JupyterHub.

### Recommended four steps for remote server install (unmodified `.env` file to full LetsEncrypt SSL certificate)

#### Step 1 ####
Follow steps for first install (step 1-6, unmodified `.env` file after `git clone`) then test if the JupyterHub server can be accessed at `https://<server IP address>` using a Chrome or Firefox browser. First install uses default settings - dummy_authenticator, self-signed SSL certificates for running on `localhost` machine. The `localhost` IP address can be replaced with the server IP address.

#### Step 2####
Get a domain name and assign it to the JupyterHub server. Test if the JupyterHub server can be accessed through the fully qualified domain name using `https`.

#### Step 3####
Get GitHub OAuth credentials and record these in the `.env` file (around line 67), replacinf the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` and `GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL` with the correct entries from GitHub. In the `.env` file (around line 37) make sure you replace `JUPYTERHUB_AUTHENTICATOR=dummy_authenticator` with this entry, `JUPYTERHUB_AUTHENTICATOR=github_authenticator`. For high volume access, make sure you also obtain an access token from `https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/` and record the access token using the `.env` file `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable (around line 73). Test GitHub OAuth by restarting the containers using `./restarthub.sh`

#### Step 4####
To replace the self-signed SSL certificate with LetsEncrypt certificates, replace the `.env` file entry `JUPYTERHUB_SSL=use_ssl_ss` with `JUPYTERHUB_SSL=use_ssl_le` (around line 86), as well as the `JH_FQDN`, `JH_EMAIL` and `CERT_SERVER` variables in the `.env` file (around line 92). Leave `CERT_SERVER` blank. Then run `./restarthub.sh` on a terminal.

# Installation Guide - Some Details for Remote Servers

## Prepare Jupyter Notebook server
Git clone https://github.com/PHI-Toolkit/jupyterhub-deploy-docker-localhost. Change to the `jupyterhub-deploy-docker-localhost` folder and run the steps below.

## Install Docker, Docker Compose and make on your remote Virtual Machine (VM)

1. Run the `install-docker-bionic.sh` to install Docker and Docker Compose on a VM running Ubuntu Bionic.
2. If the VM is not running Bionic Beaver, run the `upgrade-distro.sh` script. Be sure to replace the source and destination OS in the `sed` statement.
3. Make sure to exit the VM and log back in for changes to take effect. Run `docker images` to check if you have access to docker without sudo. If running `docker images` generates an error, run `sudo usermod -aG docker [replace-with-your-username]`.

## JupyterHub Authentication

This build of JupyterHub has three options for Authentication. Go to about Line 18 of the `.env` file and set the environment variable `JUPYTERHUB_AUTHENTICATOR` to the selected option.
* tmp_authenticator
* dummy_authenticator (default, see `.env-template` for details)
* github_authenticator (thru OAuth, requires obtaining GitHub credentials, see below)
* hash_authenticator
* native_authenticator (new)

There is no need to change or update any .env settings for initial one-user (you) launch and testing. The default setting `dummy_authenticator` uses the default user `jovyan` whose password you can set in the `.env` file.

### GitHub authentication
#### Obtain your GitHub Account Credentials
If you will be using GitHub Oauth to authenticate users to JupyterHub, you need to sign up for a GitHub Account:
1. Go to https://www.github.com and create an account if you do not have one yet.
2. Remember your GitHub user name. You will use this for #3 below.
3. Open the file `userlist` with your text editor and add your GitHub user name below "jovyan admin" as below:
> `<github user name> admin`

#### Obtain GitHub OAuth Credentials
* Log in to GitHub
* Go to Developer Settings (https://github.com/settings/developers) - create new Oauth App
* Record the following information:
  * GitHub Client ID
  * GitHub Client Secret
  * GitHub Callback URL: This should be of the form https://"mydomain.com"/hub/oauth_callback if with a domain name (remember to replace "mydomain.com" with your domain name, as obtained from the step above, "Using a Domain Name".)
* Copy-paste each of these to right `.env` section (about Line 23):

> `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<github client id>`

> `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<github client secret>`

> `OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL=https://mydomain.com/hub/oauth_callback`

If using localhost, replace "mydomain.com" in OAUTH_CALLBACK with "localhost" (i.e., "https://localhost/hub/oauth_callback").

### Native Authentication

#### Quick Start
1. `jovyan` is the default admin user. You can change this setting in the `.env` file.
2. On first launch, do not sign in with `jovyan` and default password. This only works for `dummy_authenticator`. Instead, go to https://localhost/hub/signup (change `localhost` to your fully qualified domain name) to sign up as a user.
3. `jovyan` is the default admin user in `userlist` and, after sign up, will be authorized  by default after log in. Be sure to change the  admin user in production. Admin user also needs to sign up.
4. To authorize non-admin users, go to https://localhost/hub/authorize (change `localhost` to your fully qualified domain name)

#### Reference for more information
For more information, go to the native authentication [documentation](https://native-authenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Renewing LetsEncrypt certificates
The `letsencrypt` container automatically checks if the LetsEncrypt certificate is about to expire (at 60 days old) and automatically downloads a new certificate as needed. 

## Upgrading JupyterHub to a newer version

Upon runnng `starthub.sh`, if you see an error message saying you need to run `jupyterhub upgrade-db`, you can do the following:
1. Run `stophub.sh`.
2. Comment option 1 of the `command:` section of the `docker-compose.yml` (if running without LetsEncrypt) or `docker-compose-letsencrypt.yml` (if running with LetsEncrypt), and uncommenting option 2 lines (this runs `jupyterhub upgrade-db`)
3. Run `docker-compose build`.
5. After running the database upgrade, run `stophub.sh` again, uncomment comment out option 2 lines, uncomment option 1 lines and then run `docker-compose build` again.
5. Run `starthub.sh`.

# JupyterHub Logs / Launch Issues

## Logs: Old base64 cookie-secret detected in /data/jupyterhub_cookie_secret.
* While jupyterhub is running, type the following commands:
> `$ docker exec -it jupyterhub /bin/bash`
* This brings you to the jupyterhub bash prompt. Type the following command to regenerate a new cookie secret:
> `# openssl rand -hex 32 > "/data/jupyterhub_cookie_secret"`

## Browser: 403 : Forbidden
* Add your GitHub username to the `userlist` file as described above.

## JupyterHub Logs: socket.gaierror: [Errno -2] Name or service not known
* If you see this error in the logs it means the JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_HOST_IP is misconfigured.

## Windows user
* There may be slight differences in how Chrome or Firefox behaves compared to installations on Linux or Mac (YMMV).

## HTTP Error
If you get the error:
> An HTTP error occurred when trying to retrieve this URL.
HTTP errors are often intermittent, and a simple retry will get you on your way.
ConnectionError(ReadTimeoutError("HTTPSConnectionPool(host='conda.anaconda.org', port=443): Read timed out.",),)

...and the `buildhub.sh` script is building the user container image (running Dockerfile.custom), just run `make notebook_base`, then `make notebook_body`, and lastly `make notebook_image` to resume rebuilding the Jupyter Notebook singleuser container image (shows up as `jupyterhub-user` if you run `docker images` on the terminal).

## `[Errno 111] Connection Refused` or in the JupyterHub logs after running `starthub.sh` you see the error message `error: [ConfigProxy] Proxy error:  Error: connect EHOSTUNREACH 172.18.0.3:8080` or `tornado.curl_httpclient.CurlError: HTTP 599: Failed to connect to 172.18.0.X port 8080: Connection refused`
This error could be due to JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_HOST_IP changing value after restarting Docker server (after server reboot). To address this error, run the script `get_service_host_ip.sh` at the command line, which will provide you with the new JUPYTERHUB_SERVICE_HOST_IP value. This script automatically replaces the old value in the `.env` file with this new IP address.
